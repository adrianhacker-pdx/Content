# Building a profile hover with 3box

By design public addresses in Ethereum are represented by a 40 character hexadecimal hash which is unappealing for users. This problem can be solved using profile hovers which instead of displaying a user's Ethereum address, we can display a basic social identity, think of it like using [ENS domains](https://kauri.io/ens:-beginner's-guide/e7f098b57fd24afe9b70506517dd5a63/a) but more sociable.
Here  is what a profile hover looks like:

In this tutorial, we expand on what 3Box offers and how to use the profile hovers it offers in React and HTML/CSS apps.

## Introducing the 3Box SDK and APIs

3Box helps front-end web developers to keep user data on an open storage network instead of a centralized database server, browser localStorage, or the blockchain. With 3Box, developers are able to build more secure, lightweight, and powerful applications.

All the data is publicly available but only private data can be decrypted by the user giving explicit permission.

3Box provides a JS SDK and various APIs. The profile hover uses the [profiles API](https://docs.3box.io/api/index#profiles) to get basic data of the user such as the name.

There are different APIs available and these are the most important ones:

[Identity API](https://docs.3box.io/api/index#identity): This one allows developers to perform various actions such as getting the decentralized identity (DID) from a user address or linking new addresses to the DID

[Auth API](https://docs.3box.io/api/index#auth): This API allows developers to request access to a user's 3box profile and spaces.

[Profiles API](https://docs.3box.io/api/index#profiles): This API allows developers to perform various actions such as getting public and private information from the user profile.

[Read more about all the available APIs](https://docs.3box.io/api/index).

## Overview on profile hovers

Integrating profile hovers into an application not only is a good way to associate hex addresses to 3Box profiles but it also increases social verification of other users in the network.

If you have a decentralized application and you want to replace user's hex addresses with human-readable names, images, descriptions, and other social metadata in their application's UI then you're in the right place! 
The `profile-hover` component consists of two elements: `tile` and `hover`, they both have different functionalities.

The `tile` element appears when we need to display an Ethereum address. It has a default style associated with it but you can also decide not to use it.

The `hover` element appears once the `tile` element is hovered and it pulls the data from the user's 3Box profile such as name, image, and description.

As outlined in the previous section the profile-hover uses the profiles API to get the data but if the user didn't sign up with 3Box it shows the shortened address and a blocky identicon like this:

## Using profile hovers in a React app

Before diving in, we need to have NodeJS installed, follow the guide
[here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

As a first step, we will need to create a React application in which we will use
profile hovers.

```shell
npx create-react-app profile-demo
```

Afterward, install the `profile-hover` component.

```shell
cd profile-demo
npm i -S profile-hover
```

Open `App.js` and import the package:

```javascript
import ProfileHover from 'profile-hover';
```

At this point, we can use the imported component to our liking. There are various
ways with which we can customize how to display it.

Let's modify the `App.js` in order to see how to use this feature.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import "./App.css";
import ProfileHover from 'profile-hover';

const App = ({}) => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className='ethAddress'>
        <ProfileHover orientation="right" url="www.kauri.io" showName tileStyle address='0x3f46680099cf623163c96747a8addb85a1da1cd1' />
      </div>

      <div className='ethAddress'>
        <ProfileHover orientation="right" noImgs showName tileStyle address='0xec1f83cf6a6dc7ee04a79c99a67cd3800111b355' />
      </div>
      <div className='ethAddress'>
        <ProfileHover orientation="right" noCoverImg showName tileStyle address='0x499c9c826a356f72926a258afa63bcdb4df33702' />
      </div>
      <div className='ethAddress'>
        <ProfileHover orientation="right" noCoverImg showName tileStyle address='0xfc27bf5bdc304ea27e74fd3f514e5400f0a9e76d' />
      </div>
      <div className='ethAddress'>
        <ProfileHover orientation="right" noImgs showName address='0x781901682d3e9341a6c195ee6fe58047a9235f07' />
      </div>
      <div className='ethAddress'>
        <ProfileHover orientation="right" displayFull showName address='0x442dccee68425828c106a3662014b4f131e3bd9b
' fullDisplay />
      </div>
      <div className='ethAddress'>
        <ProfileHover orientation="right" showName address='0xd75bb1e6ef53d0c65bcf53ecb19d8c64a7026c58' noTheme>
          0xa8ee0babe72cd9a80ae45dd74cd3eae7a82fd5d1
        </ProfileHover>
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

export default App;
```

Let me explain the example above, `ProfileHover` is the React component used to
define various profiles, there are multiple properties associated with it for example
we can use a custom theme for the `Tile` instead of using the default one by using
the `noTheme` property or we can also specify the location of the hover.

Last but not least, let's also modify `App.css` so we can visualize the
profiles in a smooth way adding the following lines:

```css
.ethAddress {
        padding: 20px 0px 0px 40px;
        height: 80px;
}
```

Now we can run the React app.

```shell
npm start
```

## Using the HTML element

Create a new HTML file named `index.html` and add the script before the closing `HTML` tag.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/profile-hover"></script>
```

To display an address, we need to add the following tag in the `body` section.

```html
<threebox-address data-address='0x442dccee68425828c106a3662014b4f131e3bd9b'></threebox-address>
```

There are few other ways to customize our profile hover, we can add `data-display='full'`
to show the entire address instead of the shortened one.

We can also decide to not use the default styling using `data-theme='none'`.

This is an example of how we can use profile hovers in a HTML App.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Profile demo</title>
    <link href="./App.css" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class='ethAddress'>
      <threebox-address data-address='0x442dccee68425828c106a3662014b4f131e3bd9b' data-display='full'></threebox-address>
    </div>
    <div class='ethAddress'>
      <threebox-address data-address='0xfc27bf5bdc304ea27e74fd3f514e5400f0a9e76d' data-theme='none'>
      </threebox-address>
    </div>
  </body>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/profile-hover@1.1.1/dist/widget.js"></script>
  </html>
```

## Customize the profile hover

Imagine you like the hover but you want to change how they are shown,
this is possible. Let's take a look at the important properties.

The `address` property displays the profile hover since every 3Box
profile is associated with an address.

The `showName` property makes it possible to show the user's name from their 3Box profile,
if we don't use the property it shows the address shortened. If a user didn't add a
name to the profile, it will show the shortened address.

The `url` property allows redirecting to a specific link when clicking on the `Tile`.

The `displayFull` property shows the entire address instead of the shortened address.
Remember that if we add the `showName` property after, it will override it (look
at the penultimate profile in the example above ).

These are the most important properties, if you want to take a look at all of them,
[read more in the documentation](https://github.com/3box/profile-hover#prop-types).

## Conclusion

We have seen how to use this feature, now I hope you will use it to improve your
UI.
